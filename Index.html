    <h1> 100 Years of Musical History</h1>
    <h2> The musical history of the last hundred years shows how music has accompanied and reflected the social, cultural, and technological changes in the world. From the jazz and blues that gave rise to rock, to the rise of pop, hip hop, electronic music, and reggaeton, each decade has brought new sounds, fusions, and movements that transformed the way music is created and listened to. The shift from radio to streaming and the current influence of platforms like TikTok reveal how music not only evolves but also adapts to the media of each era, connecting entire generations through rhythms and emotions. </h2>

    <h2> 1920s ‚Äì 1930s: The birth of modern music </h2>
    <p> At this stage, music began to acquire a truly global character thanks to radio, sound film, and the growing recording industry. The 1920s are known as the 'Jazz Era,' as this genre born in New Orleans rapidly spread across the United States and the world, transforming into the sound of a generation. Figures like Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Bessie Smith paved the way, taking jazz from small clubs to international stages. Swing and big bands began to gain strength, preparing the ground for the great boom of the 1930s. </p>
    <p> The blues, which had emerged in African American communities in the southern US, solidified as one of the most influential genres. Artists like Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters brought an emotional and direct style that would later inspire rock, soul, and R&B. At the same time, gospel was growing within African American churches, with powerful voices that conveyed faith and resilience, influencing future icons like Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles. </p> 
    <p> Technology played a crucial role: the invention of the electric microphone allowed for new ways of singing, with softer and more intimate voices, giving rise to the figure of the crooner (like Bing Crosby). Additionally, 78 rpm records and the expansion of radio brought music into millions of homes for the first time.Meanwhile, music in Latin America was also experiencing a renaissance: Argentine tango (Carlos Gardel) was attaining worldwide fame, while in Cuba genres such as son cubano and rumba began to spread, laying the foundations for salsa and other Caribbean rhythms.The Great Depression of the 1930s did not stop music; rather, it made it an emotional refuge. The swing of big bands (Count Basie, Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller) offered joy and escapism in difficult times, while blues expressed the harshness of everyday life. </p>
    <p> Overall, the 1920s and 1930s marked the beginning of modern popular music: styles were born that would later give rise to rock, pop, and urban music, and the first international idols were established. </p>

  <h2> 1940s ‚Äì 1950s: The golden era and the birth of rock </h2>
  <p> The 1940s and 50s were a transitional time in music, marked by two major moments: first, the rise of swing and big bands in the 40s; then, the explosion of rock and roll in the 50s, which forever changed youth culture. </p>
  <p> In the 1940s, music was profoundly influenced by World War II. The big bands of Glenn Miller, Count Basie, and Duke Ellington offered an energetic sound that lifted the spirits of both soldiers and civilians. However, after the war, maintaining these large orchestras became costly, and gradually they were replaced by smaller groups. This gave rise to bebop, a more complex and experimental style of jazz led by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonious Monk, which turned jazz into a sophisticated art rather than dance music.</p>
  <p> In parallel, electric blues began to sound strong, especially in Chicago, with figures like Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. This electrification of the blues was the direct seed of rock.</p>
  <p> The 1950s marked a true cultural revolution with the birth of rock and roll. Inspired by African American rhythm and blues, country, and gospel, a youth-driven, rebellious, and danceable genre emerged that broke down racial barriers in music. Chuck Berry, with his guitar riffs and lyrics about cars and youth, was one of its founders. Little Richard brought energy, explosive piano, and charisma; and Elvis Presley, with his unique image, voice, and style, became the ‚ÄúKing of Rock and Roll,‚Äù bringing this genre to worldwide fame.</p>
  <p> In these years, the melodic voices of crooners like Frank Sinatra also shone, who captivated millions with his romantic style, and the first teenage idols like Pat Boone. In the realm of country music, artists like Hank Williams solidified their status as legends, contributing to the classic American sound.</p>
  <p> Meanwhile, in Latin America, music was also experiencing a great moment: in Cuba, P√©rez Prado's mambo was conquering dance halls across the continent and even in the United States; in Mexico, rancheras and the golden age of cinema popularized Jorge Negrete, Pedro Infante, and Lola Beltr√°n; in Brazil, samba was strengthening as a national symbol.</p>
  <p> Together, the 1940s and 1950s represent the transition between post-war orchestral music and the birth of modern youth music. Rock and roll not only introduced a new sound: it established a cultural and generational revolution that would lay the foundations of popular music for the second half of the 20th century.</p>

  <h2>1960s - 1969: The cultural explosion!</h2>
  <p> The 1960s were a decisive decade for modern music. It was a period of social and cultural revolution, marked by civil rights movements, the Vietnam War, and youth counterculture. Music became the language of protest, freedom, and experimentation.</p>
  <p>In the United Kingdom, the so-called British Invasion emerged, led by The Beatles, who revolutionized not only pop music and rock but also the way youth culture was consumed and understood. Alongside them, The Rolling Stones, The Who, and The Kinks contributed a rawer and more rebellious rock.</p>
  <p>In the United States, folk and protest songs were the channel for social struggles, with figures like Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Simon & Garfunkel. At the same time, soul and R&B experienced a golden era thanks to Motown Records, which launched artists like Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, The Supremes, and Aretha Franklin.</p>
  <p>Psychedelic rock developed as a reflection of hippie culture, linked to the use of psychedelic drugs and festivals like Woodstock (1969). Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, The Doors, and Jefferson Airplane took rock into experimental territories. Bands like Pink Floyd began their psychedelic journey that would later evolve into progressive rock.</p>
  <p>Latin American music also underwent transformations: in Brazil, bossa nova was born with Jo√£o Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim; in Cuba, popular music retained the son and began the evolution towards salsa; and in Mexico, bolero and romantic ballads gained ground with artists like Los Panchos.</p>
  <p>In addition, technology took a leap: the 33 rpm LP became popular, allowing for complete albums instead of just singles. This paved the way for conceptual albums like The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper‚Äôs Lonely Hearts Club Band.</p>
  <p>Overall, the 1960s were the decade where music established itself as a cultural engine and symbol of generational change, blending art, rebellion, politics, and spirituality.</p>

  <h2>1970s - 1979: Diversification and new musical identities</h2>
  <p>The 1970s were a decade of expansion and diversification of styles. If the 60s had been the explosion of counterculture, the 70s consolidated and multiplied genres, giving rise to movements that would mark the rest of the 20th century.</p>
  <p>In rock, very different variants emerged: progressive rock (Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes) focused on long structures, experimentation, and virtuosity. Hard rock and heavy metal were born with bands like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath, characterized by powerful riffs and more aggressive sounds. In contrast, punk rock (Ramones, Sex Pistols, The Clash) appeared in the late decade as a direct response against the complexity of progressive and the dominance of superbands, claiming a raw, simple, and rebellious style.</p>
  <p>Disco music was one of the greatest cultural phenomena. With artists like the Bee Gees, Donna Summer, and Gloria Gaynor, it filled nightclubs and dance floors, becoming the iconic sound of the second half of the 70s. Its glamorous aesthetic and infectious rhythms marked an entire generation.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, funk and soul evolved with figures like James Brown, Stevie Wonder, and Earth, Wind & Fire, who directly influenced the future of hip hop and urban music.</p>
  <p>In the neighborhoods of the Bronx (New York), around 1973, hip hop was born, initially as a cultural movement with DJs, MCs, breakdancing, and graffiti. Pioneers like DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, and Afrika Bambaataa laid the foundations for what would become the most influential genre on the planet in the following decades.</p>
  <p>In Latin America, music also transformed: in Brazil, Brazilian popular music (MPB) with Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil mixed tradition with modernity; in Mexico, romantic ballads and rock in Spanish began to consolidate (Jos√© Jos√©, Juan Gabriel, El Tri); and in the Caribbean, Jamaican rhythms like Bob Marley's reggae became a global movement of peace and resistance.</p>
  <p>The 1970s also marked the beginning of large megaconcerts and festivals, with spectacular stages and an audience that turned musicians into superstars.</p>
  <p>Overall, this decade represented musical plurality: from the virtuosity of progressive rock to the minimalism of punk, from the disco euphoria to the commitment of reggae, and from funk rhythms to the birth of hip hop.</p>

  <h2>1960s ‚Äì 1970s: The cultural and sound revolution</h2>
  <p>This decade marked a true musical and social revolution. Music ceased to be just entertainment and became a vehicle for protest, identity, and experimentation.</p>
  <p>Rock reached its maturity with new currents such as psychedelic rock, progressive rock, and hard rock. Folk and protest songs gained strength with messages of peace, civil rights, and social resistance. Soul and R&B solidified the African American influence in popular music. Reggae began to emerge from Jamaica, paving the way for its global expansion. It was also the time of Woodstock (1969), a festival symbolizing the hippie spirit, peace, and counterculture.</p>
  <p>The rise of rock and the British invasionThe Beatles revolutionized popular music with a mix of melodic simplicity, harmonic innovation, and studio experimentation. Their evolution from youthful songs to conceptual works like Sgt. Pepper‚Äôs Lonely Hearts Club Band forever changed the idea of the album as art.The Rolling Stones represented the more rebellious and raw side of rock, inspired by the blues.This 'British invasion' opened the door for other bands like The Who, The Kinks, and Pink Floyd, who expanded the boundaries of the genre.</p>
  <p>Psychedelia, progressive and experimentationHippie culture, the use of psychedelic drugs, and the spirit of liberation drove new ways of composing and playing in bands such as: Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Pink Floyd</p>
